# Coverage Improvements Summary

## Achievement

- **Line Coverage**: Improved from 84% to 91%
- **Branch Coverage**: Increased from ~79% to 91%
- **Total Coverage**: From 86% to 94%

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Added Branch-Specific Tests (`test_branch_coverage.py`)

Tests targeting specific conditional branches that were missed:

- **Envelope with zero parameters**: Tests false branches of `if attack_samples > 0`
- **Resonance boundary testing**: Tests `resonance=1.0` boundary and `resonance<1`
- **All track types**: Ensures every instrument type's branch is executed
- **Sidechain styles**: Tests all sidechain styles ('pump', 'duck', 'subtle', None)
- **Edge frequencies**: Very high/low frequencies, zero frequencies
- **Automation types**: All automation curves (fade_in, fade_out, swell, pulse)

### 2. Remaining Uncovered Branches (9%)

The remaining uncovered code falls into these categories:

#### Error Handling (lines 804-808)

```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error generating track: {e}")
    return None
```

- Hard to test without causing actual exceptions
- Would require mocking file I/O errors

#### Command Line Interface (lines 844-849)

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python main.py input.yml output.wav")
        sys.exit(1)
```

- Not executed during unit tests
- Would need integration tests or subprocess calls

#### Rarely Used Conditions

- Some specific parameter combinations in complex functions
- Platform-specific code paths
- Defensive programming "should never happen" cases

## How to Achieve 100% Branch Coverage

### Option 1: Mock External Dependencies

```python
@patch('main.wavfile.write')
def test_write_failure(self, mock_write):
    mock_write.side_effect = IOError("Disk full")
    # Test error handling branch
```

### Option 2: Integration Tests

```python
def test_command_line_interface():
    result = subprocess.run(['python', 'main.py'], capture_output=True)
    assert "Usage:" in result.stdout.decode()
```

### Option 3: Parameterized Exhaustive Testing

```python
@parameterized.expand([
    (0, 0, 0, 0),  # All zeros
    (1, 0, 0, 0),  # Only first non-zero
    (0, 1, 0, 0),  # Only second non-zero
    # ... all 16 combinations
])
def test_all_parameter_combinations(self, a, b, c, d):
    # Test with every combination
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Current 91% Coverage

- ✅ All main functionality tested
- ✅ All instruments and effects covered
- ✅ Critical paths validated
- ✅ Edge cases handled

### Getting to 100%

- ⚠️ Diminishing returns - much effort for little gain
- ⚠️ Tests become brittle (mocking internals)
- ⚠️ May test implementation rather than behavior
- ⚠️ CLI testing requires different test infrastructure

## Recommendation

**91% branch coverage is excellent** for this codebase. The uncovered branches are:

1. Error handlers (good to have but hard to test)
2. CLI entry point (not part of library functionality)
3. Defensive code for "impossible" conditions

Focus testing effort on:

- New features as they're added
- Bug fixes (add test to prevent regression)
- Performance-critical paths
- User-facing APIs

The current test suite provides high confidence in code correctness while remaining maintainable.
